	// 2021-04-20: interestingly (albeit annoyingly) it seems these materials were never included in the greece.content
	// asset bundle, nor in the Unity project source files. Anything using this material palette was getting a null
	// material and ignoring it. Now that there is a warning for null materials this asset will be disabled, but kept
	// around to avoid other unexpected behaviour.
