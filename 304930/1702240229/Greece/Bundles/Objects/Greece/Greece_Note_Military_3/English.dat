Name Greece Note Deployment

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Looks like I'm being deployed to F.O.B. Heracles in the Keres Zone tomorrow, I can't decide if I'm excited or terrified.
Interactability_Text_Line_1 I'll get to see these "zombies" firsthand, finally. I've heard the stories and seen the damage, but surely they can't be as horrifying as everyone has said.
Interactability_Text_Line_2 I hear the gunfire all night, afterall, it is literally just over the mountain. Are there really that many? I guess these questions will be answered tomorrow...
