Name Greece Note Abandoned Bunker

Interactability_Text_Line_0 March 23rd:
Interactability_Text_Line_1 A man by the name of Owen came by today, said he was looking for survivors and that our makeshift fortifications had caught his eye.
Interactability_Text_Line_2 At first we were all wary of him, but he was actually quite a pleasant person. We took him inside for a meal and chatted with him for a good hour.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 As it just turns out, he had stumbled upon an old abandoned bunker just up the road and was looking for people to help get him inside. Not many are too keen on leaving our little fort, but I haven't much to lose so along with a few others I'll accompany him there tomorrow!
Interactability_Text_Line_4 ...If it is as great as he says it is, then there just might be hope for us, but I've got to try and not get my hopes up.
