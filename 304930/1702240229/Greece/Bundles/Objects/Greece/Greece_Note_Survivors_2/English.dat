Name Greece Note New Hope

Interactability_Text_Line_2 We did it! I wasn't sure it even existed, but the rumors were indeed true. After a week of travel we found the Hellenic Stronghold.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 Collis and I waited in line for a good 3 hours or so before they let us in, but otherwise we got in easily. They took us to this tent which is where we'll be calling home. I haven't felt this safe in forever...
Interactability_Text_Line_4 Tomorrow we are attending a "briefing" and tour of the compound. I wonder what life will be like here...
