Interactability_Text_Line_3 Hey babe, I just thought I'd write you to tell you how much I miss you and wish we could be together. It's been a really long five months stationed here and I can't wait to come home! Tell Ruppers I said "Hi", I miss the lil' twerp too. Tomorrow I'm heading back out to the Keres Zone, but don't worry, I've got my boys here to help me incase I get in a pinch. I'll be safe and home to hold you tight in no time!
Interactability_Text_Line_4 I love you baby, Krystof.
