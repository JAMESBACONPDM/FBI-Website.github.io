Message_0_Page_0 Sure thing! It was a dark and cloudy night, so dark infact that I could barely see my hands in the darkness. Well it just so happened that this dark and cloudy night was also a full moon, we just couldn't see it. There were only five of us that rotated watch duty, and I was planned for second shift. Well the time comes
Message_0_Page_1 and Orion wakes me from my slumber for my shift. I slip on my jacket, grab my flashlight and my trusty sportshot before heading out to the main entrance. I sat down and slowly scanned the horizon, back and forth. You could hear the wind gently blow, the waves collapsing against the shore, and some noisey summer bugs chirping away.
Message_0_Page_2 It was peaceful, and quiet. The thing is though, I have never trusted silence. It always comes before a storm, and so was the case. For a little backstory, earlier a small scouting party had gone out to Kala Nera Farm looking for supplies. Turns out, some of the infected weren't too happy about that and decided to follow us home.
Message_0_Page_3 So here I am, scanning the dark horizion when something red catches my eye just over the southern bank. It disappears and so I rub my eyes thinking it was just my sleep-deprived imagination. A couple minutes pass and I turn around again. This time I clearly see several sets of glowing red eyes coming over the southern hill. 
Message_0_Page_4 At first I thought it was just a few strays that found their way over here. I went over to the fence, lined up my rifle and popped off a few quick shots, downing them with ease. I reloaded and went back to my post as usual, not realizing what was now making its way over the hill. So, I go back to the front gate and start looking around again...
Message_0_Page_5 ...And that was when I heard it. The low wails of the undead, soft at first, quickly grew in volume. I whipped around to see easily twenty, no, thirty... hmm, I think it was actually more like forty-five enraged zombies almost upon our compound! My heart was pumping fast, adrenaline taking control, yet I couldn't move a muscle or mutter a word.
Message_0_Page_6 I had never before seen so many, nor had I seen those glowing red eyes before. I was too terrified to do anything for what felt like forever, watching them get closer and closer to our walls. Finally though, I snapped out of it. I began shouting to wake everyone while running through the camp towards the horde.
Message_0_Page_7 Our walls were pretty weak on the south side. I knew that if they got to them, then they'd break through. I then began lining up the perfect shot. I pulled the trigger killing three zombies with just one shot from my spotshot and then started opening fire on the others.
Message_0_Page_8 The horde was merely twenty meters out, and people were just now starting to help fire upon the zombies. We dropped one after the other, but they just kept coming! I fired and fired, but everyone I dropped just got replaced. Within seconds they hit the walls, slowly finding their way around to the weak points, chewing on everything they could.
Message_0_Page_9 I heard a loud crash and turned around to see that they had breached the entrance behind me and were now flooding into camp through both gates. People were screaming, running around in panic, guns were firing left and right, it was total chaos. All I could do was continue to fire at the incoming waves of undead.
Message_0_Page_10 I must have emptied 20 magazines into that horde before I ran out of bullets... They just wouldn't go down. Zombies were everywhere now, and the camp was clearly lost. Looking around in panic as the horde surrounded me, I saw Orion beckoning from atop the mobile home where he was defending the ramp up. Pumped up on fear and adrenaline, 
Message_0_Page_11  I knew what had to be done. I began swinging my sportshot around like a mace, wading my way through the constant stream of zombies. Slowly, I bashed my way over to where Orion was holding out, getting clawed and scrapped at the entire way. Exhausted, I managed to climb up and after a moment of catching my breath I 
Message_0_Page_12 began regaining my strength and will to fight!Orion turned to me, fear in his eyes, as he shot the last bullets in his Bulldog. "Quick, we need to jump!" he cried as he grabbed me by the collar and lead me to the edge. The Zombies now almost breathing down our necks, we made a running leap off the building, hitting the ground running.
Message_0_Page_13 I thought Orion had jumped too, but I couldn't see him in the darkness. I dared not look back for fear of what I might see. So I just ran, and I kept running, until I found my way over here.

Response_0 That was quite the story.
