Message_0_Page_0 You're out of line, soldier!
//Default Saying
Message_1_Page_0 ...Sir, we need to act sooner than later...
//Saying #1 - Coalition
Message_2_Page_0 ...These so called "Coalition" forces would make a powerful ally, but are they really what they claim to be?...
//Saying #2 - Coalition
Message_3_Page_0 ...Do we really want to chance it? They could easily invade and take away our land if they so wished...
//Saying #3 - Forces
Message_4_Page_0 ...We can't afford to lose any more men! Especially not after the recent loss of <color=legendary>Tennyson's</color> squad...
//Saying #4 - Omega
Message_5_Page_0 ...All due respect, Mr. President, but I will not stand idly by as that band of cowards murders my soldiers!...
//Saying #5 - Omega
Message_6_Page_0 ...Sure, sure. We can try more of your diplomatic politics but not at the expense of my men. No one will be losing their lives in another futile attempt to persuade the <color=uncommon>Omegas</color> to put down their weapons...
//Saying #6 - Forces
Message_7_Page_0 ...Our forces are scattered, we've lost contact with the other bunkers, and we have no front line! What do you expect me to do?!
//Saying #7 - History
Message_8_Page_0 ...That blockade was never going to work, it was a doomed plan from the start...
//Saying #8 - Forces
Message_9_Page_0 ...Yes, but we don't have the same weapons anymore! We don't even have a helicopter, let alone an airforce...
//Saying #9 - Omega
Message_10_Page_0 ...You've seen their recent convoys, it looks like they are preparing for war, so we should too...
//Saying #10 - Coalition
Message_11_Page_0 ...and yes, we'll keep collecting those airdrops, but I do not want a single one of their feet on our soil until we know who they are and why they just suddenly appeared!
//Saying #11 - History
Message_12_Page_0 ...don't villainize me, we both know that use of the Th√°nato missiles was justified! Had we not done that the horde size would have been too much for anyone to handle...
//Saying #12 - History
Message_13_Page_0 ...I do not see the benefit of trying to hold even more ground when we don't have enough men. This bunker is easily defensible and we should remain down here...
