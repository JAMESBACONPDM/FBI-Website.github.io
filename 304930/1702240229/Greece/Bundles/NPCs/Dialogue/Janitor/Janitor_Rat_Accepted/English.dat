Message_0_Page_0 Alright, listen closely. I've tracked down the spy and almost have him cornered. Assuming he didn't catch on to us, this should be easy. I'll need you to go talk to <color=rare>Officer Argus</color> to get some equipment and info on the spy's exact wareabouts. Once you know that, go make him wish he never crossed our paths.
