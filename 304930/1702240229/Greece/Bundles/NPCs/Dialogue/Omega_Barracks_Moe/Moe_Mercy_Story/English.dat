Message_0_Page_0 <i>*Sigh*</i> It's days like this that I can't shake the memory of my narrow escape. You see, shortly after the outbreak I was part of a small survivor group that set up camp just west of Kamena Vourla. All was great for quite some time.
Message_0_Page_1 My buddy Macario and I spent lots of time in the woods as kids so it was just like an extended camping trip. Then, out of the blue everything went to the gutter. A scavenging party had gone out during the full moon as we didn't know it's effects on the zombies yet.
Message_0_Page_2  Well, deep into the night we hear these growls getting closer and louder. Shouts echoed around the canyon and before anyone knew what was happening a horde of red glowing demons was upon us. They had followed the scavenging party back!
Message_0_Page_3 Macario and I, we fought with the others, we fought hard. But <pause> there were too many. We got overwhelmed and overrun. Marcario got separated from me, surrounded by the horde. All I could do was watch in horror. 
Message_0_Page_4 I ran, I ran and ran barely making it out alive myself. I made it out, but he didn't. My best friend. What pains me the most is that he's still there, roaming around as one of them. I'd go and release him myself but, I've tried. Several times. I just can't bring myself to do it.

Response_0 I can do it for you.
Response_1 I'm sorry to hear that.
