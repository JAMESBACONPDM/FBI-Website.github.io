Message_1_Page_0 Hello there <name_char>, I was just talking to <color=legendary>Sergeant First Class Damien</color> here about setting up a hunting party. My squad spotted some horrifying mutated zombies near Farsala and are looking for others to help defeat them, are you interested?

Message_6_Page_0 How goes the hunt?
Message_7_Page_0 You truly are a rigorous fighter. You defeated three of the most horrifying monsters to roam Greece with barely a scratch. I'm glad you are on our side.
