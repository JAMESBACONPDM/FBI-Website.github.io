Message_0_Page_0 Is... Was... Not particularly important anymore. However, since you asked; I indeed was. Unfortunately, I lost my eye and camera escaping the Theologos Lighthouse.
Message_0_Page_1 For a while, I was part of a small band of survivors down there. That is, until the undead found their way to our little island. In the panic it caused, I fell part way down the ladder dropping my camera, breaking some bones, and losing an eye.
Message_0_Page_2 I tried returning several times, but I saw something. Glimmers, an Anomaly, at the top of lighthouse. It stared at me before vanishing. I've been too scared to investigate; but since you're interested do let me know what you find.
